Feature selection is a crucial data preprocessing technique that effectively reduces the dataset size and enhances
the performance of machine learning models. Evolutionary computation (EC) based feature selection has
become one of the most important parts of feature selection methods. However, the performance of existing
EC methods significantly decrease when dealing with datasets with thousands of dimensions. To address this
issue, this paper proposes a novel method called importance-guided particle swarm optimization based on MLP
(IGPSO) for feature selection. IGPSO utilizes a two stage trained neural network to learn a feature importance
vector, which is then used as a guiding factor for population initialization and evolution. In the two stage of
learning, the positive samples are used to learn the importance of useful features while the negative samples
are used to identify the invalid features. Then the importance vector is generated combining the two category
information. Finally, it is used to replace the acceleration factors and inertia weight in original binary PSO,
which makes the individual acceleration factor and social acceleration factor are positively correlated with the
importance values, while the inertia weight is negatively correlated with the importance value. Further more,
IGPSO uses the flip probability to update the individuals. Experimental results on 24 datasets demonstrate
that compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms, IGPSO can significantly reduce the number of features
while maintaining satisfactory classification accuracy, thus achieving high-quality feature selection effects. In
particular, compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms, there is an average reduction of 0.1 in the fitness
value and an average increase of 6.7% in classification accuracy on large-scale datasets.
1. Introduction
The advancement  of information  collection  technology  has led to
an increase  in the number  of features  in classification  tasks, resulting
in a large amount  of redundant  and irrelevant  features  within  high-
dimensional  datasets  [1]. These extraneous  features  can negatively
impact  the classification  accuracy.  Feature  selection  is a popular  and
efficient  data preprocessing  technology,  which can select highly  dis-
tinguishable  features  from original  features,  so as to reduce  irrelevant
features  and redundant  features.  The benefits  of feature  selection  in-
clude reducing  the training  time and storage  space, and improving  the
generalization  ability  of the classification  models  [2].
Although  feature  selection  has been a popular  research  topic for
decades,  finding  optimal  subsets  becomes  increasingly  difficult  for the
datasets  with high dimensions  [3,4]. In recent decades,  numerous
researchers  have proposed  various  approaches  to address  this issue.
Traditional  search  methods  such as sequential  forward  or backward
floating  selection  cannot  find satisfactory  subsets,  thus, researchers
have turned  towards  evolutionary  computation  (EC) [5]. EC methods

More importantly,  they have superior  global search  capabilities  that are
lacking  in traditional  methods,  making  them advantageous  for feature
selection  tasks [6].
Particle  swarm  optimization  (PSO) is one of the EC methods  and
has been widely  used in feature  selection  [7–9]. But EC based feature
selection  methods  are suitable  to be used for solving  small-scale  fea-
ture selection  problems  with tens to hundreds  of dimensions  [10,11].
When confronted  with large-scale  datasets  containing  thousands  of
dimensions,  these algorithms  become  time consuming  and cannot  ob-
tain satisfactory  performance.  Furthermore,  the effectiveness  of swarm
intelligence-based  algorithms  is heavily  influenced  by population  ini-
tialization  [12]. Thus, Xue et al. utilized  the ReliefF  for population
initialization  in NSGA-II,  resulting  in a significant  improvement  in
algorithm  performance  compared  to the compared  algorithm  without
special  population  initialization  [13]. The ablation  experiment  con-
ducted  in [13] demonstrates  that an excellent  initialized  population  can
expedite  convergence  and enhance  the ability  to identify  the optimal

subset. Similar conclusions were also obtained in [14]. Nevertheless,
existing methods primarily rely on simplistic mathematical analysis to
guide population initialization, which may be effective on small-scale
problems. Therefore, a new population initialization method is required
for solving large-scale feature selection problems.
The balance of the exploitation and exploration is important for EC
based feature selection methods [15–18]. Algorithms focusing solely
on exploitation tend to overlook numerous potential areas and become
trapped in local optima solutions, while some other algorithms em-
phasizing exploration discover multiple sub-optimal solutions without
effectively identifying the optimal subset. Some algorithms adjusted
the balance between the exploration and exploitation based on the
frequency of position flipping [19–24]. However, in many feature
selection tasks, not all features are equally important, and performing
the same operation on all positions leads to a waste of computational
resources, while slowing down the training process of the model.
Based on the above issues, this paper proposes a novel particle
swarm optimization algorithm called IGPSO, which utilizes the neural
networks to facilitate population initialization and coordinate pop-
ulation exploitation and exploration. The proposed approach shows
greater potential in identifying superior feature subsets, which can
achieve higher classification accuracy with fewer features. Specifically,
the contributions of this study are as follows:
1.A novel neural network is introduced for importance vector
generation. These importance vectors include the significance
level of each feature and are employed for both population
initialization and population evolution.
2.A two stage training method utilizing positive and negative ex-
amples is proposed. By separately training with normal samples
and disordered samples using positive and negative sample sets,
respectively, useful information related to features is extracted
while disregarding irrelevant information.
3.An importance-guided population updating strategy is proposed,
which uses the importance value to replace the acceleration
factors and inertia weight in the traditional PSO algorithm.
Specifically, the acceleration factor is positively correlated with
the importance value, while the inertia weight is negatively
correlated with the importance value. This allows for differ-
ential guidance of features based on their respective levels of
importance, thereby regulating both population exploitation and
exploration processes more effectively.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2
reviews the related work about FS methods and particle swarm op-
timization. Section 3describes in detail our proposed methodology.
Section 4presents the experimental design and parameters. Section 5
reports the experimental results and analysis. Finally, Section 6pro-
vides the conclusions of this work and suggests future directions for
research.
2. Related work
In this section, we provide a brief literature review of FS methods
and the PSO algorithm.
2.1. Feature selection
Feature selection plays an important role in many practical ap-
plications, Yin et al. proposed a robust multilabel feature selection
method that leverages graph structure and fuzzy rough sets to consider
feature interactions and dependencies, achieving superior performance
and robustness [25]. Similarly, Yin et al. [26] introduced a robust MFS
algorithm RMSMC considering feature multi-correlations. With the help
of the fuzzy granulation mechanism, the uncertainty and ambiguity of
multilabel data are characterized by fusing multiple fuzzy𝛽coverings.Among the typical feature selection methods, there are three main
categories: filter method, wrapper method, and embedded method
[27]. The filter method typically utilizes statistical measures such as
correlation coefficient, mutual information, and information gain to
evaluate the relationship between features [28]. Well-known filter
methods include ReliefF [29] and mRMR [30]. On the other hand,
the wrapper method uses a learning method to assess the selected
feature subset, with higher computational cost but often achieving
better performance compared to the filter method [31]. Lastly, the
embedded method combines feature selection with machine learning
methods to achieve optimal performance. Once the learning process is
complete, the features used in the classifier are selected [13,32].
Due to global search capability and the do not require of any
prior knowledge, EC methods are popular among feature selection
methods [33,34]. Population initialization of the EC methods has a
significant impact on the results. To address this issue, Li et al. used a
feature weighting based on mutual information for population initial-
ization, called feature weighting directed initialization [35]. Similarly,
Xue et al. used the results of ReliefF as a basis for population ini-
tialization [13]. The results show that it is important to consider the
initialization of the population as a crucial factor.
2.2. Particle swarm optimization
Evolutionary computation has attracted the attention of a wide
range of researchers due to its powerful search capabilities [36]. There
is a swarm intelligence algorithm called PSO, which has been paid at-
tention by researchers and has been applied to many practical problems
because of its simplicity, efficiency and effectiveness.
Inspired by the behavior of birds, particle swarm models have
been proposed to solve continuous optimization problems. In the PSO
algorithm, a group of particles represents candidate solutions, and the
optimal solution is determined through the population update. Similar
to other EC algorithms, PSO employs a fitness function to evaluate
the quality of each particle. In addition, the optimal position of each
particle itself and its neighbors are recorded as pbest (𝑝𝑏) and gbest
(𝑔 𝑏), respectively, which guide the particle on a directional exploration.
Specifically, for a particle, the update formula ofi-dimensional for
velocity is as follows:
𝑣𝑡+1
𝑖=𝑤×𝑣𝑡
𝑖+𝑐1×𝑟1× (𝑝𝑏𝑖−𝑥𝑡
𝑖) +𝑐2×𝑟2× (𝑔 𝑏𝑖−𝑥𝑡
𝑖) (1)
where𝑡represents the𝑡th iteration in the population iteration process,
𝑥represents the position of the particle,𝑤denotes the inertia weight,
𝑐1and𝑐2are two hyperparameters representing the acceleration factor,
and𝑟1and𝑟2are two random numbers between 0 and 1. Eq. (2) is used
to update position𝑥.
𝑥𝑡+1
𝑖=𝑥𝑡
𝑖+𝑣𝑡+1
𝑖(2)
The original PSO algorithm is designed for solving continuous opti-
mization problems but does not perform well when applied to discrete
optimization problems such as feature selection. Feature selection in-
volves denoting selection as 1 and discarding as 0. Kennedy et al. first
introduced the concept of binary PSO to address this issue. Cervante
et al., on the other hand, combined BPSO with information theory
methods to tackle feature selection problems effectively. The main dis-
tinction between BPSO and original PSO lies in their update equation.
In BPSO, Eq. (3) is used.
𝑥𝑡+1
𝑖={
1,if𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑 ()≤𝑠(𝑣𝑡+1
𝑖)
0,otherwise(3)
where𝑠()means the sigmoid function. Since then, BPSO has been
widely adopted in the field of feature selection. In the original BPSO
algorithm, the sigmoid function was commonly used as a transfer
function, also known as the S-shape function. Mirjalili et al. initiallySwarm  and Evolutionary  Computation  91 (2024)  101760  
2

Y. Xue and C. Zhang
proposed the use of the V-shape function as a transfer function, and ex-
perimental results demonstrated that it could enhance the performance
of BPSO [37]. However, due to the absence of ablation experiments,
it remains uncertain which specific component is responsible for this
improved performance. Drawing inspiration from quantum computing,
Zheng et al. introduced quantum computing into the BPSO algorithm
for the first time [38].
2.3. PSO-based feature selection
Nguyen et al. introduced Stick BPSO by reformulating momentum
as stickiness and velocity as flipping probability [19]. The stickiness
factor considers flipped particle states; particles that have not flipped
for an extended period are more likely to flip, thus enhancing pop-
ulation activity. However, solely considering unconstrained flipping
in time dimensions will expand potential subset space and increase
computational costs while hindering population convergence. Chen
et al. employ PSO with an evolutionary multitasking paradigm to solve
feature selection problems [39]. The first task involves selecting from
all the original features, while the second task involves selecting only
from the top-ranked features. Zhang et al. applied BPSO to address
spam detection issues and mitigate population prematurity through
mutation operators, thereby enhancing algorithm performance [40].
Experimental data indicated superior performance compared to other
compared algorithms. Tran et al. proposed VLPSO, which has a variable
and dynamic length on high dimension features [41]. The results shown
that VLPSO can achieve better classification accuracy in a shorter time.
In addition, the competitive swarm optimization (CSO) algorithm is
proposed in order to explore novel potential algorithms [42]. Nguyen
et al. used performance constraints combined with Relief to improve
the population diversity and local search efficiency of CSO [43]. Be-
sides, SVM was used as a surrogate model to accelerate the evaluation
process. The results shown that the introduction of an adaptive perfor-
mance constraint can force particles to learn from other high-quality
particles, thus guiding the population towards a more promising search
area. However, this step makes the population more inclined to exploit,
thus the particles are more likely to fall into local optimality. From the
above review, it can be seen that existing PSO based feature selection
algorithms often rely on mathematical methods or pure evolutionary
computation methods to guide population initialization and update
strategic, which leads to these algorithms being unable to lead sat-
isfactory initialization when facing large-scale datasets and unable to
have appropriate theories to guide population updates in this case. In
this work, we proposed the focal neural network to guide population
initialization and particles updating.
3. Proposed method
In this section, we first introduce the overall architecture of IGPSO
and then present the details of each element composing the framework.
3.1. Overall framework
The overall feature selection framework is shown inFig. 1. The
framework consists of a two-stage trained neural network called focal
neural network, and an importance-guided particle swarm optimiza-
tion algorithm. The purpose of the focal neural network is to learn
the importance of all features in the different two stages, the first
stage is dedicated to finding effective features and removing invalid
features, then the second stage is to identify redundant information.
After that, the vector 𝐢𝐩was generated, which can comprehensively
reflect the importance of the features. The generation process of𝐢𝐩
was described in Eq. (6). In the population updating, the importance-
guided particle swarm optimization algorithm not only considers the
relationship among the current position, the individual optimal solution
and the global optimal solution, but also considers the importance of
the features, so as to guide the population to find the optimal solution
efficiently.3.2. Focal neural network
3.2.1. Focal module
In a real-world dataset, there are many invalid features that are
‘‘unimportant’’ or even ‘‘harmful’’ to the machine learning methods.
The role of the focal neural network is to focus on the ‘‘important’’
features, so that the machine learning methods can execute tasks faster
and better by using the valid information in the dataset.
The focal module is composed of the following parts: a data normal-
ization layer, an attention vector 𝐀, and a MLP with two hidden layers.
At the beginning of training, every element in𝐀is initialized to 1 to
ensure that each feature is equal in the beginning. Assuming𝑎𝑖is the
𝑖th element in𝐀. For any𝑎𝑖, the𝑎∗
𝑖is obtained by a sigmoid function
as Eq. (4). After mapping each element of𝐀,𝐀∗is generated.
𝑎∗
𝑖=1
(1 +𝑒−𝑎𝑖). (4)
After the normalization of the dataset, the dataset 𝐗is fed into the
focal module for training. Each instance 𝐱can be seen as a vector:
𝐱=(𝑥1, 𝑥2,…, 𝑥𝐷)
where each component represents a feature.𝐷means the original
number of features in the dataset.
First, the dataset 𝐗is multiplied bit by bit with the attention vector
𝐀∗to obtain vector 𝐗𝐀, which is used as the input of the neural
network.
𝐗𝐀=𝐗⊙𝐀∗(5)
where ‘‘⊙’’ indicated the Hadamard product.
Then, in the process of the neural network training, the parameters
in𝐀are continuously updated through the backpropagation algorithm,
so that𝐀can finally learn the importance of different features.
Finally, the importance vector 𝐢𝐩is obtained by mapping vector 𝐀∗,
and the data is scaled to the range of [0.1 0.9] by the function, which
is shown in Eq. (6).
𝑖𝑝𝑖=𝑎∗
𝑖−𝑎∗
𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝑎∗
𝑚𝑎𝑥−𝑎∗
𝑚𝑖𝑛∗ 0.8 + 0.1 (6)
where𝑎∗
𝑖represents the𝑖th element in𝐀∗, and𝑎∗
𝑚𝑖𝑛and𝑎∗
𝑚𝑎𝑥mean
the maximum and minimum values in𝐀∗, respectively. The reason for
scaling the elements in the𝐢𝐩to [0.1 0.9] is that it makes it possible
for each feature to be selected, which helps to give more diversity
to the particle swarm optimization in the initialization stage and the
population updating.
3.2.2. Neural network training
After normalizing the real-world dataset to the input dataset 𝐗, 70%
of the samples are used as the training set, and the remaining of the
samples are used as the validation set. The samples in the training
set are further divided into positive and negative samples, where the
positive samples account for𝑘%of the training set, the remaining (1-
𝑘%) of the training set are used as the negative samples, and the labels
of the negative samples are replaced by wrong labels. In this study,𝑘
is set to 70. Different choices of𝑘are shown in ablation study 5.2.1 .
In training, we find that the direct training has certain defects,
the model is easy to overfit and the accuracy cannot satisfy us in
some cases. We found that the use of negative samples for training
can well solve the problem of overfitting and improve the accuracy.
The reason for this may be that when only positive samples are used
for training, the model will automatically learn useful information and
ignore invalid information, but for redundant information, the model
will still consider them helpful, and training with negative samples can
help the model identify the redundant information.
Two focal modules named𝐹 𝑀𝑝𝑜𝑠and𝐹 𝑀𝑛𝑒𝑔are initialized before
the training. Firstly, the positive sample set is utilized as the training
set for𝐹 𝑀𝑝𝑜𝑠, after that, the output 𝐀∗

3.3. Importance-guided  particle  swarm optimization
In a standard  binary  PSO, the position  of the next stage is not
associated  with the current  position.  Unlike  the smooth  movement  in
the original  PSO, the particles  change  their current  position  by flipping
the position  from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0. This kind of probabilistic  binary
flip is not effectively  described  by velocity,  on the contrary,  the use
of flip probability  is a potential  solution.  Therefore,  in the proposed
IGPSO,  instead  of using the velocity  vector 𝐯, we use the flip probability
vector 𝐏to describe  the possible  changes  in the particles,  where the
value of each entry represents  the flip probability  of the corresponding
position.  Prior to this, we obtained  the vector 𝐢𝐩that describes  the
importance  of the feature.  Based on𝐢𝐩, the important  features  aremore inclined  to exploitation,  while the unimportant  features  are more
inclined  to exploration.
The velocity  vector  of the particle  swarm  algorithm  is mainly  com-
posed of three parts: momentum,  cognitive,  and social factors.  All the
three factors  need to be modified  for the binary  PSO. We replace  and
modify  momentum,  cognitive,  and social factors  using the relevant
factors  of the importance  vector 𝐢𝐩. In addition,  we replaced  the accel-
eration  factors  with the random  numbers.  Specifically,  for a particle,
the flipping  probability  of the𝑖-dimension 𝑃𝑖is updated  according  to
the following  Eq. (7):
𝑃𝑖= (1 −𝑖𝑝𝑖) ×𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖+𝑖𝑝𝑖
2×|𝑝𝑏𝑖−𝑥𝑖|+𝑖𝑝𝑖
2×|𝑔 𝑏𝑖−𝑥𝑖| (7)
where𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖is a random  value between  0 and 1,𝑖𝑝𝑖means  the
importance  value of the𝑖-dimension.
According  to the𝑃𝑖, the position  of the𝑖-th dimension  should  be
updated  according  to Eq. (8).
𝑥𝑡+1
𝑖={1 −𝑥𝑡
𝑖, 𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑 < 𝑃𝑖
𝑥𝑡
𝑖, 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒(8)
where𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑 is a random  number  between  0 and 1. When𝑃𝑖is greater
than𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑 , the position  of𝑖-th is flipped,  otherwise  it remains  in the
same position.
For a swarm  intelligence  algorithm,  in addition  to the popula-
tion updating,  the initialization  of the population  is also a crucial
part. Therefore,  in IGPSO,  we design  a novel population  initialization
strategy  according  to the importance  of features.

3.4. Analysis of IGPSO
3.4.1. Population updating
According to the Eq. (7), the flip probability 𝐏is mainly influenced
by the importance vector 𝐢𝐩and a random number. In the process of
evolution of PSO, according to the relationship among Gbest, Pbest and
the current position, the situation can be divided into four categories,
which are shown in Eq. (10).
𝑃𝑖=⎧
⎪
⎪
⎨
⎪
⎪⎩(1 −𝑖𝑝𝑖)×𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖, 𝑥𝑖=𝑝𝑏𝑖=𝑔 𝑏𝑖(1 −𝑖𝑝𝑖)×𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖+𝑖𝑝𝑖
2, 𝑥𝑖=𝑝𝑏𝑖≠𝑔 𝑏𝑖(1 −𝑖𝑝𝑖)×𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖+𝑖𝑝𝑖
2, 𝑥𝑖=𝑔 𝑏𝑖≠𝑝𝑏𝑖(1 −𝑖𝑝𝑖)×𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖+𝑖𝑝𝑖, 𝑥𝑖≠𝑝𝑏𝑖=𝑔 𝑏𝑖(10)
Eq. (10) describes the flipping probability of a single bit in a particle
during evolution. When the evolution begins, it is very likely that the
situation will be𝑥𝑖≠𝑝𝑏𝑖=𝑔 𝑏𝑖, and as the particles continue to evolve
until the end of the evolution process, the situation is likely to become
𝑥𝑖=𝑝𝑏𝑖=𝑔 𝑏𝑖. Without taking into account the possible disturbance
caused by𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖, the𝑃𝑖has a maximum value of𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖+ (1 −𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖) ×𝑖𝑝𝑖
and a minimum value of𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖−𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖×𝑖𝑝𝑖. Compared with the random
number𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑 as Eq. (8), the former has a higher probability of flipping,
while the latter tends to remain unchanged.
In addition, taking into account the importance value𝑖𝑝𝑖, it can
be easily concluded that particles are more inclined to explore at the
beginning of evolution and more inclined to exploit at the later stage
of evolution. The advantage of this setup is that the particle swarm
can quickly find the most beneficial area and start exploitation in that
area. Thus, the algorithm has the ability to balance exploration and
exploitation.
3.4.2. The analysis of the complexity
IGPSO consists of two main parts: the importance vector generation
process and the particle swarm updating process. As for the particleswarm updating process, suppose iterations𝑀, population size𝑆,
and input dimension 𝐷, we can deduce that the time complexity of
population initialization is𝑂(𝐷 𝑆). For a particle, in each iteration,
the time complexity for updating flipping probability vector 𝐏is𝑂(𝐷),
determining whether flipping occurs is also O(D), then updating PB and
GB costs𝑂(1). Thus, the time complexity for a particle in one iteration is
𝑂(𝐷). It can be directly inferred that the time complexity of𝑆particles
in an iteration is𝑂(𝐷 𝑆), and considering the number of population
iterations𝑀, the time complexity of the particle swarm optimization
algorithm is𝑂(𝑀 𝐷 𝑆).
The time complexity of the importance vector generation process,
which is primarily for MLP training. For a dataset with𝑁samples
and𝐷-dimensional features, the time complexity is𝑂(𝑁 𝐷2). Since the
importance vector generation process is implemented based on Pytorch,
the time consuming is much less than the particle swarm updating
process, so the complexity of IGPSO can be considered as𝑂(𝑀 𝐷 𝑆),
which is comparable to the time complexity of traditional PSO.
4. Experimental setup
The datasets utilized in the experiments are described inTable 1,
each accompanied by a link to web pages dedicated to their specifics.
Notably, these datasets originate from different real-world scenarios
and with different sizes. Categorized based on the number of features,
the datasets are divided into two groups: small-scale and large-scale.
The majority of these datasets were initially included in the UCI Ma-
chine Learning Repository http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php and
the scikit-feature selection repository [35]. Each dataset was split into
two partitions: the training set, which comprised 70% of the original
dataset and was randomly selected, and the test set, which included the
remaining examples.
The neural network parameters were updated using the SGD op-
timizer, with a momentum of 0.9 and a weight decay of 0.00001.
During training, the learning rate was gradually reduced using the
cosine annealing strategy, with a minimum value of 0.001, which were
popular settings.
For all EC-based FS algorithms, the stopping criterion was set at
10,000 evaluations, denoted as ME (Max Evaluations) = 10,000. All
other configurations were consistent with the settings in their original
algorithms. For IGPSO, the population size is set to 100, which is same
consistent with the settings in other related articles.
All algorithms were run independently 30 times. To enhance the
statistical significance of the findings, we employed a T-test at a 95%
confidence level.
We chose KNN (K = 3) as the classifier in the experiment. The reason
for this is twofold. Firstly, the KNN algorithm lacks feature selection
ability and exhibits weak classification performance, which allows the
difference between feature subsets to be fairly revealed. Secondly, it is
highly susceptible to the influence of invalid and redundant features.
These characteristics make it an ideal choice for evaluating the feature
selection capabilities of different algorithms.
Furthermore, to further illustrate IGPSO’s performance, we intro-
duced fitness values as a third evaluation criterion. Fitness values are
calculated as Eq. (11):
𝐹 𝑖𝑡𝑛𝑒𝑠𝑠 = (1 −𝑎𝑐 𝑐) × 0.9 +𝑠𝑧
𝑆 𝑍× 0.1 (11)

ReliefF [29], RFS [44], VLPSO [41], SBPSO [19], CNNIWPSO [45],
EARFS [46], and CCSO [43]. Among them, VLPSO, SBPSO and CCSO
are the outstanding PSO-based algorithms proposed in recent years,
CNNIWPSO and EARFS combining deep learning method with feature
selection, while mRMR, ReliefF and RFS are well-known non-EC fea-
ture selection methods. For the fairness of comparison, the settings of
the PSO-based methods are given in Section 4, while for the non-EC
method, we chose the same number of features as the one selected by
IGPSO, since they could not determine the number of features.
5.1.1. Results on small-scale datasets
Table 2shows the accuracy of the best subsets selected by IGPSO
and the seven comparison algorithms for small-scale datasets, as well
as the accuracy of original dataset evaluated by the KNN classifier.
The symbols (+)/(-) in this table indicate that the result obtained by
the IGPSO algorithm was significantly superior/inferior to that of the
comparison algorithms, while (=) signifies no significant difference
between the IGPSO algorithm and the comparison algorithms. The best
mean value for each dataset is highlighted in bold. The W/D/L metric
indicates the number of times IGPSO demonstrates significant superi-
ority/similarity/inferiority compared to the compared algorithms, as
determined by the T-test. The RANK metric represents the average
ranking of performance over all datasets.
As can be seen from Table 2, compared with the comparison al-
gorithms, IGPSO has achieved good performance on 11 small-scale
datasets, among which IGPSO has achieved the best performance on
7 datasets (01, 05, 07–11). According to the results of the T-test,
IGPSO shows a significant advantage in most cases, and for the original
dataset and most compared algorithms, IGPSO achieves a significant
advantage on more than 10 datasets. Compared to the powerful SBPSO
and CCSO algorithms, IGPSO also achieved better performance on
7 datasets and 4 datasets, respectively. Overall, IGPSO outperforms
other compared algorithms on small-scale datasets. In addition, this
conclusion can also be intuitively reflected in the average ranking. The
average ranking of the IGPSO algorithm on 11 small-scale datasets
is 1.64, far exceeding the second-place CCSO algorithm, which fully
demonstrates the stability of IGPSO in different scenarios.
Table 3illustrates the ability of IGPSO and four EC-based compared
algorithms to reduce features. As can be seen from Table 3, the six
algorithms have different degrees of feature reduction ability, among
which CCSO obtains 3 smallest datasets (05, 06 and 07), and IGPSOobtains 6 smallest datasets. However, the size of the subset is one of
the important factors affecting the classification accuracy. Therefore,
we introduce the fitness function Eq. (11) to comprehensively evaluate
the feature selection ability of these algorithms.
Table 4shows the fitness scores for the best subsets generated by
the different algorithms. We can intuitively find that IGPSO achieved
independent optimal fitness values on 5 datasets (01, 03–05, 11), and
tied for the first place with CCSO on 4 datasets (02, 08–10), and
achieved 9 optimal fitness values. This demonstrates IGPSO’s excellent
feature selection and stability. In addition, from the results of the T-test,
IGPSO showed an overwhelming advantage compared to the most other
algorithms. Besides, IGPSO showed significant differences on the most
datasets. Compared to EARFS, IGPSO showed a significant advantage
on 8 datasets, and there was no significant difference on 3 datasets.
IGPSO is better than SBPSO on 5 datasets and no significant difference
on 6 datasets. We can get the conclusion that the importance vector
generated by the neural network has advantages over stickiness or
mathematical analysis, which can better guide the particle to update.
In addition, population initialization based on the importance of fea-
tures may also be responsible for this phenomenon. Overall, IGPSO
outperforms most compared algorithms on small-scale datasets. It is
worth noting that attention vectors are often not sufficiently trained
on small-scale datasets, so IGPSO cannot fully demonstrate its power
on small-scale datasets.
5.1.2. Results on large-scale datasets
In this section, we analyze the performance of IGPSO versus other
algorithms on large-scale datasets. Table 5shows the performance of
IGPSO and the compared algorithms, and we can easily see that IGPSO
achieves the best classification accuracy on all 11 datasets. Compared to
the results inTable 2, the gap between IGPSO and the other algorithms
is large, and the advantages of IGPSO on large-scale datasets are more
obvious. Besides, with the increase in the size of the datasets, the
difference is also gradually increasing. In addition, from the analysis of
the results of the T-test, IGPSO has achieved a significant advantage on
more than 9 datasets. For the average ranking, IGPSO achieves a good
score of 1.36, and the average ranking of CCSO, which ranks second,
is 2.00.
Table 6shows the number of features found by the compared
algorithms and IGPSO. As can be seen from this table, IGPSO exhibits
strong feature selection capabilities on large-scale datasets, with only
about 20% of the features retained for most datasets (11–13, 16–17, 21)
and achieves an increase in classification accuracy. For datasets 15, 16,
20, and 22, the proportion of the removed features is more than 85%,
especially for dataset 20, the proportion is 93.4%. Even for the dataset
with the highest proportion of retained features, IGPSO removed 72.5%
of features and achieved an accuracy improvement of about 10%. As a
result, IGPSO performs better than the other algorithms on large-scale
datasets.
Table 7shows the performance of the other algorithms and IGPSO
about fitness values. It can be seen that IGPSO achieves the best fitness
value on 11 datasets. For the ReliefF and SBPSO algorithms, IGPSO
obtains a significant advantage on all 13 datasets, while for mRMR,
VLPSO, CNNIWPSO and CCSO, the number is 12. In addition, the
average ranking of IGPSO is 1.15, which is an exciting result, while
the second-placed EARFS achieves an average ranking of 2.85. The
reason for this phenomenon may be that the neural networks are
fully trained by the large-scale datasets, and the importance vector
efficiently reflects the relationship between features, so that IGPSO can
determine the region where the best subset is located and further mine
the potential feature set. However, when other algorithms meet with
large-scale datasets, due to the increasing number of features and the
exponential increase in feature combinations, the algorithm cannot find
the region where the optimal subset is located within a certain number
of iterations, thus unable to achieve a balance between exploration and
exploitation.Swarm  and Evolutionary  Computation  91 (2024)  101760

5.2. Ablation  study
5.2.1. Ablation  experiment  on the proportion𝑘of positive  samples
In this section,  we explore  the impact  of the ratio of positive
and negative  samples  on the performance  of the algorithm.  First, we
selected  two datasets  for the ablation  experiment  from the small-
scale datasets  and the large-scale  datasets,  respectively.  Then we set 6
proportions  of 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100%.  The results  are
shown  in Fig.2. From Fig. 2, we can see that for all datasets,  with the
increase  of the proportion 𝑘, the classification  accuracy  first increases
and then decreases.  For the Movement  and MFS datasets,  the classifi-
cation accuracy  reaches  the maximum  value when𝑘= 70, and for the
other two datasets  are 80 and 90, respectively,  but the classification
accuracy  at𝑘= 70 is still a relatively  ideal result.  Therefore,  we chose
𝑘= 70 as the parameter  setting  for this experiment.
5.2.2. Ablation  experiments  for different  modules
In this section,  we conduct  ablation  experiments  on different  mod-
ules in IGPSO  to demonstrate  that the excellence  of IGPSO  is attributed
to all the modules  rather than a single module.  First, we utilize  the focal
neural  network,  and use uniform  sampling  instead  of PSO to generate
subsets.  The subset  generation  method  is detailed  in [46], and this
algorithm  is denoted  as Focal-1.  Second,  we replace  the focal neural
network  with ReliefF  to illustrate  the effectiveness  of the focal neural
network,  and this model is named  as ReliefF-PSO.  Third, we eliminate
the positive  and negative  training  operation  and only perform  positive
sample  training,  which is named  as IGPSO-wpn,  to demonstrate  the
effectiveness  of positive  and negative  sample  training.  We use the same
four datasets  for this ablation  experiment,  and present  our results  in
Fig. 3.
Fig. 3illustrates  the feature  selection  ability  of the algorithms  on
different  datasets.  ReliefF-PSO  performs  the worst of all algorithms,
which may be due to the fact that the focal neural  network  has a
strong  feature  ranking  ability  and can better represent  the relationship

between  features  than ReliefF.  Besides,  the performance  of Focal-1
is also unsatisfactory,  which may be due to the fact that the non-
evolutionary  algorithm  cannot  sample  the entire subset  space well, thus
missing  some potential  subsets.  It is worth noting  that for the MFS
dataset,  Focal-1  achieves  the same classification  accuracy  as IGPSO,
which may be due to the particular  dataset.  Finally,  the performance  of
IGPSO-wpn  is slightly  worse than that of IGPSO,  which illustrates  the
effectiveness  of the positive  and negative  sample  training  methods.
5.2.3. Ablation  experiments  for parameter  settings
In this section,  we conduct  ablation  experiments  on different  param-
eter settings,  including  population  size, number  of iterations.  First, weSwarm  and Evolutionary  Computation  91 (2024)  101760

select five different  population  sizes as the parameters  of the model,
and compare  the fitness  value of the model in different  settings.  The
result is shown  inFig. 4. Then, we set the ME from 0 to 10000,  then
recorded  the variation  of fitness  value with the number  of iterations,
which is shown  inFig. 5.
It can be seen from Fig. 4that for most datasets,𝑝𝑠= 10is not a
satisfactory  choice.  When the𝑝𝑠is between  40 and 130, the results  are
different,  which may be related  to the characteristics  of the datasets
themselves.  But it is worth mentioning  that when the𝑝𝑠is between  40
and 130, the overall  performance  of the algorithm  is satisfactory.  The
reason  for this phenomenon  may be that when the population  size is too
small, the particles  is more likely to fall into the local optimal  solution,
so that the satisfactory  results  cannot  be obtained.  In order to ensure
the fairness  of the experiments,  we set the𝑝𝑠to 100 in the comparison
with other methods,  just as the settings  in other PSO-based  methods.
Fig. 5shows the variation  of fitness  value with the number  of
iterations.  Obviously,  the fitness  value decreases  when the number  of
iterations  increases.  In particular,  at the beginning  of the iteration,  the
fitness  value decreases  faster, and as the number  of iterations  increases,
the decline  slows down. However,  it is important  to note that the time
cost increases  as the number  of iterations  increases.  Therefore,  in order
to save the time consuming  on the one hand, and to maintain  the
fairly comparison  with other algorithms  on the other hand, we choose
𝑀 𝐸= 10000 in the comparison  experiments.

6. Conclusions  and future  work
In this paper,  a novel importance-guided  particle  swarm  optimiza-
tion with MLP is proposed  to address  the challenge  of large-scale
feature  selection.  The method  utilizes  positive  and negative  datasets
to train an importance  vectors  by a focal neural  network,  thereby
capturing  the importance  associated  with features.  The IGPSO  algo-
rithm is employed  to coordinate  population  exploitation  and explo-
ration,  enabling  rapid convergence  of the particle  swarm  in the early
stages of iteration  while focusing  on potential  space in later stages.
IGPSO  has been evaluated  on both large-scale  and small-scale  datasets,
demonstrating  superior  performance  compared  to state-of-the-art  FS al-
gorithms  on 24 datasets,  particularly  for large-scale  datasets.  However,
a limitation  of this approach  lies in the occupation  of video memory
during  focal neural  network  training.  Moreover,  the instability  of neural
network  training  will also affect the results  of the method.  In future
research,  we will explore  new neural  network  models  and investigate
other EC algorithms  to develop  stronger  feature  selection  abilities.  For
example,  KAN model has the potential  to replace  MLP for importance
vector  training.  In addition,  there are many excellent  EC algorithms,
such as DE, ACO, etc., which can be used to improve  the proposed
method.
